Notes on CFSR dataset

 - 01/28/2012 from email from bob dattore

    In ds093.2, the monthly mean dataset, we did not make any modifications, but NCEP did not encode the statistical processing fields
    (octets 47-58 and 59-70) according to the GRIB2 standard.  Instead, they did their own thing, which is described here:
    http://dss.ucar.edu/datasets/ds093.2/docs/time_ranges.html.

    ds093.2 CFSR Time Range Specification
    NCEP does not follow the GRIB2 standard to indicate the statistical processing time range for the CFSR monthly means.
    Instead, they specify octets 47-58 and 59-70 in Product Template 4.8 as follows:

    Octet(s)	Description
        47	From NCEP Code Table 4.10
        48	Should be ignored
        49	Should be ignored
        50-53	Number of grids used in the average
        54	Should be ignored
        55-58	This is "P2" from the GRIB1 format
        59	From NCEP Code Table 4.10
        60	Should be ignored
        61	Should be ignored
        62-65	This is "P2 minus P1"; P1 and P2 are fields from the GRIB1 format
        66	Should be ignored
        67-70	Should be ignored

    It is unlikely that current GRIB decoders will understand this time range specification, so the times and product types
    for the grids may appear as something very different than what they should. One alternative is to convert the grids to GRIB1 format.

   so for template 8, the following are affected by octets >= 47 :   TimeInterval[] readTimeIntervals().
   so the time unit is ok:
         47: Statistical process == 193 (table 4.10: Average of N forecasts)

   special handling:
      55-58: This is "P2" from the GRIB1 format
      62-65: This is "P2 minus P1"; P1 and P2 are fields from the GRIB1 format
